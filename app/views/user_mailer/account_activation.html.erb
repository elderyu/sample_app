<h1>Sample App</h1>

<p>Hi <%= @user.name %>, </p>

<p>
  Welcome to the Sample App! Click on the link below to activate your account:
</p>

<%= link_to "Activate", edit_account_activation_url(@user.activation_token, email: @user.email) %>
<!-- # id = authentication token -->

<p>If you didn't signup to the Sample App, I have probably fucked up the code really hard. In that case please do not click the activation link :)</p>
